# mapping_based_calibrator

In this tutorial, we present a hands-on tutorial of the `mapping_based_calibrator`, particularly its lidar-lidar calibration capabilities. Although we provide a pre-recorded rosbag, the flow of the tutorial is meant to show the user the steps they must perform in their own use cases with live sensors.

General documentation regarding this calibrator can be found [here](../../calibrators/mapping_based_calibrator/README.md).

## Setup

This tutorial assumes that the user has already built the calibration tools.
Installation instructions can be found [here](../../README.md).

## Data preparation

Please download the data (rosbag) from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_pGds5HDyt8C55sD2qEH4TJMGzIOCCyV).

The rosbag includes four pointcloud topics published by different lidar sensors and also includes `/tf_static` information.

Note that in the real-world environment, the user should record a rosbag with all of the lidar topics and tf topics that are needed, which should be similar to the provided bag. Afterward, the user could start driving the vehicle to collect the data in the rosbag and then calibrate sensors with the recorded rosbag.

## Environment preparation

### Overall calibration environment

The required space for calibration depends on the vehicle and sensors used. It is recommended to have a large enough space for the vehicle to drive around 30 to 50 meters in away that the calibration lidars observe areas that are mapped through the vehicle's trajectory. It is also recommended to ensure that the environment is rich in natural landmarks suitable for registration-based mapping in all directions. This will help the lidar capture sufficient details beyond simple features like lane surfaces or walls.

### Vehicle

Before starting the calibration, the user needs to drive the vehicle to collect the pointcloud for building the map. While recording data during the experiment, slow down the vehicle's speed as much as possible. For instance, driving slower than 2 km/hr is good for recording quality data. Also, during the experiment, try to avoid people walking around the vehicle and keep the surroundings static.

## Launching the tool

In this tutorial, we use the RDV of TIER IV (R&D Vehicle).
First, run the sensor calibration manager:

```text
ros2 run sensor_calibration_manager sensor_calibration_manager
```

In `Project`, select `rdv`, and in `Calibrator`, select `mapping_based_calibrator`. Then, press `Continue`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../images/mapping_based_calibrator/menu1.jpg" alt="menu1">
</p>

A menu titled `Launcher configuration` should appear in the UI, and the user may change any parameter he deems convenient. However, for this tutorial, we use the default values. After configuring the parameters, click `Launch`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../images/mapping_based_calibrator/menu2.jpg" alt="menu2">
</p>

The following UI should be displayed. When the `Calibrate` button becomes available, click it.
If it does not become available, it means that either the required `tf` or services are not available. In this case, since the `tf` are published by the provided rosbag, run the bag with the command `ros2 bag play lidar_lidar.db3 --clock -r 0.5` and click the `Calibrate` button.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../images/mapping_based_calibrator/menu3.jpg" alt="menu3">
</p>

Note: In the [launch file](../../sensor_calibration_manager/launch/rdv/mapping_based_lidar_lidar_calibrator.launch.xml), the top lidar is set as `mapping lidar`, and other lidars as `calibration lidars`.

## Construct a map

Once the user clicks the `Calibrate` button, the first step of the calibration process will automatically start building the map by using the NDT or GICP algorithm with the `mapping lidar`. The user can visualize the process of building the map on `RViz`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../images/mapping_based_calibrator/map1.jpg" alt="menu3">
</p>

The user can also see the log in the console, which shows that the map is being built.

```text

[mapping_based_calibrator-1] [calibration_mapper]: New frame (id=28 | kid=-1). Distance=2.26 Delta_distance0.11 Delta_time0.10. Unprocessed=0 Frames=29 Keyframes=3
```

When the rosbag finishes, the user should see the pointcloud map and the path of the lidar frames similar to the ones in the following figure:

## Estimate transformations

The process of estimating transformations sends the corresponding service call with `ros2 service call /stop_mapping std_srvs/srv/Empty` in the terminal. Note that the user can send this command before the rosbag ends if they think the data collected is sufficient for calibration.

In this tutorial, we send the command after the rosbag runs until the end. Once the command is sent, the displayed text should be as follows:

```text
[mapping_based_calibrator-1] [mapping_based_calibrator_node]: Mapper stopped through service (operator()())
[mapping_based_calibrator-1] [calibration_mapper]: Mapping thread is exiting (mappingThreadWorker())
[mapping_based_calibrator-1] [mapping_based_calibrator_node]: Beginning lidar calibration for pandar_front (operator()())
```

This process may take some time, as it involves multiple lidars' calibration. Users should remain patient and monitor the console output to track the progress of the calibration.

Once the process is complete, the displayed text should be as follows:

```text
[mapping_based_calibrator-1] [lidar_calibrator(pandar_left)]: Calibration result as a tf main lidar -> lidar_calibrator(pandar_left)
[mapping_based_calibrator-1] [lidar_calibrator(pandar_left)]:  translation:

[mapping_based_calibrator-1] [lidar_calibrator(pandar_left)]:  rotation:

[mapping_based_calibrator-1] [lidar_calibrator(pandar_left)]:   z: -0.005994
[mapping_based_calibrator-1] [lidar_calibrator(pandar_left)]:   w: 0.937887
[mapping_based_calibrator-1] [mapping_based_calibrator_node]: Lidar calibration for pandar_left finished
[mapping_based_calibrator-1] [mapping_based_calibrator_node]: Sending the results to the calibrator manager
```

The user can also see the three different colors of pointcloud in `RViz`. White for the map from the `mapping lidar`, red for the initial pointcloud from the `calibration lidars`, and green for the calibrated pointcloud from the `calibration lidars`.

## Results

After the estimation transformations process finishes, the `sensor_calibration_manager` will display the results in the UI and allow the user to save the calibration data to a file.

In the UI of the rdv project, three different TF trees are displayed: `Initial TF Tree`, `Calibration Tree`, and `Final TF Tree`.

- The `Initial TF Tree` presents the initial TF connections between sensors needed for calibration.
- The `Calibration Tree` shows the calibrated transformation between sensors, in this tutorial, `pandar_top`, `pandar_front`, `pandar_right`and `pandar_left`.
- The `Final TF Tree` depicts the TF tree after incorporating the updated calibrated transformation. As autoware utilizes the concept of [sensor_kit](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/how-to-guides/integrating-autoware/creating-vehicle-and-sensor-model/creating-sensor-model/), the final transformations required to comply to the specifications is `sensor_kit_base_link` to `pandar_front_base_link`, `pandar_left_base_link`, and `pandar_right_base_link`. These transformations are performed by the [calibrator interface](../../sensor_calibration_manager/sensor_calibration_manager/calibrators/rdv/mapping_based_lidar_lidar_calibrator.py) related to this project. The red arrows indicate that the final transformations changed after the calibration process.

To evaluate the calibration results, users can measure static objects within the pointcloud map, such as stationary vehicles, traffic cones, and walls.

The image below displays the vehicle within the pointcloud, allowing for a comparison of results before and after calibration. It is evident that the initial pointcloud from `calibration lidars` (shown in red) has been successfully calibrated (shown in green) and is now aligned with the `mapping lidar` (shown in white).

## FAQ

- Why does the calibration fail?

  - In most cases, the failure is due to mapping issues. The possible error messages are listed below and should be displayed in the console. For these cases, restart the experiment and drive more stably and slowly.
    - Mapping failed. Angle between keyframes is too high.
    - Mapping failed. Interpolation error is too high.
    - Mapping failed. Acceleration is too high.
  - Bad initial calibration is also a common cause for failures in the calibration process. If the mapping succeeds and there are good calibration features, but still the calibration fails it is usually due to the nature of classic pointcloud registration algorithms.
  - Check the `RViz` to see if any keyframe number on the path is red (normally it is white). If it is red, there is a chance that the motion of the vehicle is not smooth. We recommend the user calibrate with more stable movement again.
  - If it is not feasible to restart the experiment, the user could tune the parameters in the `Calibration criteria parameters` described in the [documentation](../../calibrators/mapping_based_calibrator/README.md). However, keep in mind that if the user sets the threshold too high, the accuracy of the calibration result will also decrease.
  - Check whether all of the lidars apply time synchronization.
  - Make sure that the environment is rich in natural landmarks suitable for registration-based mapping in all directions. This will help the lidar capture sufficient details beyond simple features like lane surfaces or walls.

- Which registration algorithm (NDT or GICP) should I select for mapping?
  - In our previous experiments, GICP gives better results for the mapping but takes more time to build the map. On the other hand, NDT is faster but sometimes does not build an accurate map such as when ground points do not align in a plane.
