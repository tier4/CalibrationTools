## Purpose

The package `mapping_based_calibrator` allows extrinsic calibration between 3d lidar and 3d lidar sensors, as well as baselink and 3d lidar sensors used in autonomous driving and robotics.

## Inner-workings / Algorithms

### lidar-lidar calibration

The calibrator is designed to estimate the transformation between lidar and lidar sensors. It starts by employing a lidar, called the `mapping lidar`, for mapping purposes. Then, it utilizes pointcloud registration algorithms to calibrate the remaining lidars, known as `calibration lidars`, to the `mapping lidar`. Specifically, the calibration process encompasses three primary steps: constructing a map, preparing calibration data, and finally estimating the transformations.

A prerequisite for this calibrator is an environment rich in natural landmarks suitable for registration-based mapping in all directions, ensuring that the lidar captures sufficient details beyond simple features like lane surfaces or walls.

#### Step 1: Construct a map

The calibrator designates one of the lidars (defined in the launch file) as the `mapping lidar` for mapping purposes. Pointclouds from this lidar utilize either the NDT or GICP algorithm to calculate the pose and also store the pointclouds as a map for future usage. The following rules are applied while constructing the map.

- For each `N` meters, a keyframe will be saved, which is used for mapping and estimating transformation.
- If the distance between the last frame and the current pointcloud is more than the `D` meters, the pointcloud will be saved as a frame, which is used to complement keyframes.

It is recommended to select the lidar that has the highest resolution and best FOV as the `mapping lidar`.

#### Step 2: Prepare calibration data

After the mapping has been completed, some preprocessing is necessary before estimating the transformations between lidars. In the explanation below, we assume that there is only a `calibration lidar` that needs to be calibrated with the `mapping lidar`.

##### Data synchronization

As the tool aims to apply registration algorithms on the pointclouds from both the `mapping lidar` and the `calibration lidar` to estimate the transformation between them, it's crucial to ensure those pointclouds share the same timestamp. However, the `calibration lidar` may not be synchronized with the `mapping lidar`, meaning these pointclouds cannot be directly used together during movement. To address this, the tool first needs to interpolate the pose of the `mapping lidar` at the timestamp of the `calibration lidar` in the map.

##### Data selection

To refine our calibration process, the tool first temporarily pairs `mapping lidar` keyframes with their closest `calibration lidar` frame, and then selects the final calibration pairs (`mapping lidar` keyframes and `calibration lidar` frame) based on the criteria listed below.

- The pairs have low time difference and low interpolation error (such as speed, estimated acceleration, etc.) between the keyframe and the `calibration lidar` frame.
- The pointlcoud in `calibration lidar` frame has enough features for calibration, which the tool filters out the pointcloud that has low variance in the z-axis that is mostly a plane.

##### Data preprocessing

For the `calibration lidar` pointcloud to have more points to apply the registration algorithm, the calibrator would need a high-resolution pointcloud from the `mapping lidar`. Therefore, we augment the keyframe's pointcloud with all the frames' pointcloud near it. As the resulting pointcloud has redundant information, we downsample the pointcloud to quite a fine-grained resolution, which is called augmented pointcloud.

#### Step 3: Estimate transformations

Once the data is prepared for calibration, the tool applies registration algorithms, such as NDT and GICP, to estimate the transformation between the pointcloud from the `calibration lidar` and the augmented pointcloud from the `mapping lidar`.

### base-lidar calibration

Instead of calibrating the transformations between lidars, we can also utilize the map generated by the `mapping lidar` to calibrate the transformation between the `mapping lidar` and the `base_link`.

#### Step 1: Construct a map

The first step of base-lidar calibration would be the same as [Step 1](#step-1-construct-a-map) in `lidar-lidar calibration`.

#### Step 2: Extract ground plane from the pointcloud

After constructing the map, we could get the augmented pointcloud from `mapping lidar`, which would be the same process as [Step 2](#step-2-prepare-calibration-data). Afterward, the tool utilizes PCA and a segmentation algorithm for extracting the ground plane from the augmented pointcloud.

#### Step 3: Estimate transformation

To estimate the transformation between the `mapping lidar` and the `baselink`, the tool needs to calculate the transformation between the lidar and the ground pose, as well as the transformation between the ground pose and the baselink.

The transformation between the lidar and the ground pose is calculated by utilizing the normal vector and a point on the ground plane. To estimate the transformation between the ground pose and the baselink, the tool first determines the initial ground-pose-to-baselink using the initial lidar-to-baselink and lidar-to-ground-pose transformations. Then, the tool projects this initial ground-pose-to-baselink transformation onto the xy plane to estimate the transformation between the ground pose and the baselink.

## Known issues/limitations

- As described in [Step 2](#step-2-prepare-calibration-data), the calibrator interpolates the pose of the `mapping lidar` at the timestamp of the `calibration lidars`. Therefore, the calibrator highly requires time synchronization between all of the lidar sensors.
- It is required that the `mapping lidar` have high resolution. For the `calibration lidar`, both high and low resolutions are acceptable. Therefore, the vehicle with only low-resolution lidars could not use the calibrator.
- A good initial calibration parameters is required for the calibrator. Better initial calibration parameters could help the registration algorithm estimate a more reliable transformation.

## Pro tips/recommendations

- To build the map accurately, drive your vehicle at the lowest feasible speed, for example, 2 km/h would be a good speed. If the user drives the vehicle too fast, the pointcloud will be distorted.
- To create an accurate map, the surroundings of the calibration area are crucial. Ensure that the environment is rich in natural landmarks suitable for registration-based mapping in all directions, which is shown in the image below. This will help the lidar capture sufficient details beyond simple features like lane surfaces or walls.
